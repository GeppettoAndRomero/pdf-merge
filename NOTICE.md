## pdfjs-dist — Apache-2.0

- **Package:** [`pdfjs-dist`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfjs-dist)
- **Upstream:** [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) (Mozilla) — parses each
  PDF and rasterizes its first page onto a `<canvas>` to draw the per-file
  thumbnail used to confirm merge order; the actual merge is done separately by
  pdf-lib.
- **License:** Apache License, Version 2.0.
- **Modifications:** none. The library is used unmodified, as an npm dependency.

A copy of the Apache License, Version 2.0 is available at
<https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> and is included within the `pdfjs-dist`
package (`node_modules/pdfjs-dist/LICENSE` in this repository's dependency tree).

`public/pdf-merge/pdfjs/` contains two data directories pdf.js fetches on demand at
runtime (not bundled into the JS): `cmaps/` (Adobe's predefined CMaps for CID-keyed
fonts, BSD-style license) and `standard_fonts/` (Foxit's substitute metrics for the
14 standard PDF fonts, BSD-style license, plus the Liberation fonts under the SIL
Open Font License). Both are copied unmodified from `pdfjs-dist`'s own distribution,
and each directory retains its own `LICENSE*` file.
